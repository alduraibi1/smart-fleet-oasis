# Experimental Files

This folder contains experimental features and test implementations that are not part of the main application.

## Files moved here:
- Duplicate customer pages (Customers.tsx, CustomersV2.tsx - consolidated into EnhancedCustomers.tsx)
- Multiple contract page variations (Contracts.tsx, ContractsSimple.tsx, etc. - consolidated into ContractsMain.tsx)
- Legacy report and HR pages (consolidated into enhanced versions)

## Guidelines:
- Use this folder for testing new features before integrating them into the main app
- Keep experimental code separate from production code
- Clean up unused experiments regularly
- Document any useful patterns or components that could be extracted
