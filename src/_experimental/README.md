# Experimental Components

This folder contains experimental or alternative implementations of components that are not part of the main application.

## Guidelines

- Components in this folder should not be imported by the main application
- Use this space for testing new features or alternative approaches
- Clean up regularly - move stable components to main codebase or delete unused experiments

## Current Experiments

- None (moved legacy pages here or removed duplicates)
